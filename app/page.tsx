                I enjoy building; finding a project that challenges my present way of thinking
                allows me to grow and develop more effectively. My current obsession is
                accessibility; I want everyone to have a consistent experience while visiting my
                websites. I also create blog posts to strengthen my ability to communicate train of
                thought.
